# Code of Conduct

Everyone interacting in RConsortium-supported projects is expected to follow the [Linux Foundation Code of Conduct](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/about/code-of-conduct/). This includes all infrastructure used in the development of RConsortium-supported projects, such as codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms, and mailing lists.

In general, this means that everyone is expected to be open, considerate, and respectful of others no matter what their position is within the project.

# Reporting

All incidents should be reported by [contacting the RConsortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/contact).
